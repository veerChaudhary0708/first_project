# PyTorch Neural Style Transfer ðŸŽ¨

This project is a Python implementation of the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, originally described in the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by Gatys et al. It allows you to take two imagesâ€”a content image and a style imageâ€”and blend them together to create a new image that has the content of the first and the artistic style of the second.



## Features

* Uses a pre-trained **VGG19** network to extract content and style features.
* Employs the **L-BFGS optimizer**, which often produces higher-quality results.
* Includes **Total Variation Loss** as a regularization term to create smoother, more coherent images.
* All settings are centralized in a simple and easy-to-use **"Control Panel"** directly in the main script.
